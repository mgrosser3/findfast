# 🔍 Find Fast

Find Fast (short ff) is a lightweight and efficient command-line tool for
quickly searching files for text patterns—similar to the classic grep.

## Features

- **Hidden files** (starting with `.`) are skipped
- **Inaccessible files** (no read premissions) are skipped with error message
- **Recursive search** through all subdirectories
- **Duration measurement** at the end of execution
- **UTF-8 support** for console output

## Usage

**Syntax**

```bash
ff <pattern> <path>
```

**Example:**

Search for the word “grep” in the project's readme file:

```bash
ff grep README.md
```

Search in a directory (recursive):

```bash
ff "TODO|FIXME" ./src
```

## 🔧 Build

### What You Need

**Haskell Toolchain**

You need the Following software:

1. **GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)** - Version 9.6 or higher
2. **Cabal** - Version 3.12 or higher

### Building the Project

When building with ...

```bash
cabal build
```

... the artifacts are placed under `dist-newstyle/`.
The structure is long by design to separate builds by architecture, GHC version,
and package version:

```
dist-newstyle/
  build/
    x86_64-windows/     ← target architecture
      ghc-9.4.8/        ← GHC version
        findfast-0.0.1/ ← package name + version
          x/            ← executables
            findfast/
              build/
                findfast ← the built binary
```

You usually don’t need the full path — just run the program with:

```bash
cabal run
```

Or install the binary to a simpler folder:

```bash
cabal install --installdir=build --overwrite-policy=always
```

This places the executable neatly in build/.
